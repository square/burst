Provides shadow implementations of classes in the Android SDK. All of the classes in this package ("Shadow" classes) are
annotated with the {@link org.robolectric.annotation.Implements} annotation, which causes the implementations
of the associated Android classes to be replaced, on a method by method basis, with their annotated counterparts on the
Shadow class.
